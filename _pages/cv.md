## Research Intern | Facebook AI Research
May 2021 - September 2021

Under the supervision of Herv√© J√©gou and Matthijs Douze, on image transformers and watermarking.

## Research Intern | Dassault Syst√®mes

April 2020 - August 2020  
*Dassault Syst√®mes is a French software company that develops 3D design, 3D digital mock-up, and product lifecycle management (PLM) software.*

I was a member of the Bio-Founded Modeling Team  on the subject 3D Morphogenesis. The main goal was to search and develop methods for the generation and the locomotion learning of locomoting virtual soft-robots. My work adressed some of the different topics: CPPN, GA (NEAT, CMA-ES), topology optimization, RL, differentiable physics, etc. The most promising results were obtained using genetic algorithms with a CPPN representation combined with differentiable physics for learning the locomotion behaviour.

## Software Engineer Intern | Incepto Medical
June 2019 - August 2019  
*Incepto is a start-up developing and gathering AI applications for medical imaging.*

My mission consisted in the creation of review and analysis tools for deep learning results in medical imaging. I defined the user needs with data scientists and radiologists and determined the software design with senior developers and designers. I implemented the solution, tested it with end users and proposed next steps to incrementally add features on top of it.

## Neuroscience Project | NeuroSpin
June 2018 - May 2019
*NeuroSpin is a research centre for innovation in brain imaging.*

We worked as a team of 6 students with 2 research scientists at NeuroSpin (Christophe Pallier and Timo van Kerkoerle) for the entire year (‚âà1 afternoon/week).
The goal was to design and test an experiment on how the brain encoded temporal sequences. We conceived a grammar encoding of sequences and tested different hypothesis thanks to the application and the data we collected for more than 100 players.
Our team was selected amongst the 10 best projects of the year. (over more than 100)

## Military Section Head | French Army
September 2017 - April 2018

I first underwent two months of military training at the school for French Army officers, before being assigned to a military academy called Prytan√©e National Militaire. There, I was the head of 2 sections of approximately 25 students. My mission was to help the students to pass the selections for officer's schools in the French Navy, Army and Air Force. I taught them physics and chemistry and oversee some military activities and their daily lives.
