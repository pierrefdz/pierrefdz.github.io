## About me

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">
  I am a Research Scientist at FAIR Paris (Fundamental AI Research lab at Meta).
  
  My research focuses on content protection and safety in machine learning, with a particular interest in watermarking generative models. My goal is to make content generated by AI traceable and identifiable.
  I notably developed:
  - the audio watermarking algorithm used in public research demos from FAIR, such as [Audiobox](https://audiobox.metademolab.com) and [Seamless](https://seamless.qa.metademolab), serving 100k users daily (joint work with [Hady Elsahar](https://www.hadyelsahar.io/));
  - the image watermarking algorithm used by [Imagine](https://imagine.meta.com/);
  - [Stable Signature](https://ai.meta.com/blog/stable-signature-watermarking-generative-ai/), a method to watermark generative models even if they are open-sourced.

  I did my PhD at FAIR and INRIA Rennes, advised by [Matthijs Douze](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0eFZtREAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Hervé Jégou](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=1lcY2z4AAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Teddy Furon](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=aLUbWzAAAAAJ&hl=fr). 
  Prior to my PhD I studied at [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), majoring in computer science and mathematics for visual computing. I also hold a Master's degree from [École des Ponts ](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/en) and from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) where I studied Mathematics for vision and learning.
