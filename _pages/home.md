## About me

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">
  Hi üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è! 

  I am an AI Research PhD student at Meta AI & Inria Rennes, advised by [Matthijs Douze](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0eFZtREAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Herv√© J√©gou](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=1lcY2z4AAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Teddy Furon](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=aLUbWzAAAAAJ&hl=fr). I am interested in data protection in the context of Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

  Prior to my PhD, I studied at √âcole polytechnique, majoring in computer science and mathematics for visual computing. I also hold a Master's degree from √âcole des Ponts and from Paris-Saclay University.

  I am really excited in the developement of Artificial Intelligence (more broadly Artificial Life) and of its applications in the fields of every day's life.
