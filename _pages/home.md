Hi! 

I am a graduate student at Ecole polytechnique studying Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am also pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning at Paris-Saclay University in partnership with Ponts Paris-Tech. 

I am really excited in the developement of Artificial Intelligence (more broadly Artificial Life) and of its applications in the fields of every day's life. I am interested in many topics related to computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning, particularly:
- Fairness & privacy in computer vision applications
- Soft robotics and evolutionary robotics

At the moment, I work as an intern at Facebook AI Research center in Paris, under the supervision of Hervé Jégou and Matthijs Douze.
