## 👨🏼‍💻 Short Bio

I am an AI Research PhD student at Meta AI Research and INRIA Rennes, advised by [Matthijs Douze](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0eFZtREAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Hervé Jégou](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=1lcY2z4AAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Teddy Furon](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=aLUbWzAAAAAJ&hl=fr). I work on machine learning and content protection.

I previously interned at Dassault-Systemes, on differentiable physics for generative design and shape/topology optimization, and at [Incepto Medical](https://incepto-medical.com/en), where I developed tools for data scientists and radiologists. I also spent 6 months in the French military as a section head.

Prior to my PhD I studied at [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), majoring in computer science and mathematics for visual computing. I also hold a Master's degree from [École des Ponts ](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/en) and from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) where I studied Mathematics for vision and learning.
