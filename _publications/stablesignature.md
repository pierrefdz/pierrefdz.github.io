## TL;DR (Summary)

Recent progress in image generation has made it easy to create and manipulate images in a realistic manner with models like DALL·E~2 and Stable Diffusion. 
It raises concerns about responsible deployment of these models.

Stable Signature is a watermarking technique that modifies the generative model such that all images it produces hide an invisible signature.
These signatures can be used to detect and track the origin of images generated by latent diffusion models.

## How does it work?


### Image generation with Latent Diffusion Models

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generative models that produce images by using diffusion processes in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder (like VQ-GAN).
The diffusion process is guided by a text prompt, which is used to control the generation of latents.
The images are generated by decoding the latents at the end of the diffusion process, with the help of the VAE's decoder.

By fine-tuning the decoder of the VAE, we can slightly modify all generated images, such that they hide an invisible signature.
