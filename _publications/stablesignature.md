## TL;DR (Summary)

Recent progress in image generation has made it easy to create and manipulate images in a realistic manner with models like DALL·E~2 and Stable Diffusion. 
It raises concerns about responsible deployment of these models.

Stable Signature is a watermarking technique that modifies the generative model such that all images it produces hide an invisible signature.
These signatures can be used to detect and track the origin of images generated by latent diffusion models.
